\subsection{Abstention decisions are localized and admit low-dimensional control}
\label{sec:results_localization}

We next examine where in the network the answer--abstain decision is implemented. Using causal activation patching on minimal prompt pairs, we find that abstention sensitivity is concentrated in a narrow band of late transformer layers (layers 14–20, flip rates 20–30%) rather than distributed across the network. Interventions at early and mid layers (0–12) produce weak effects (0–10% flip rates), whereas patching small contiguous windows in late layers accounts for most of the observed decision changes. This pattern is consistent with a localized decision bottleneck rather than a computation distributed across the network.

Negative controls rule out generic late-layer sensitivity. Patching activations from unrelated prompts (10% flip rate) or mismatched token positions (0% flip rate) produces negligible effects, confirming that the observed sensitivity reflects a specific causal computation associated with the answer--abstain decision.

Having localized this computation, we test whether it admits low-dimensional control. Steering along a mean-difference activation direction at the localized site (layer 14, ε=20) induces structured changes in abstention behavior (8.3% flip rate), with decision flip rates increasing as a function of intervention strength. In contrast, directions aligned with dominant activation variance (PC1, 0%), probe-based directions (2.8%), and randomized (2.8%) or label-shuffled controls (5.6%) produce weak or no effects at matched intervention strengths. These comparisons indicate that abstention-related information is not aligned with generic variance directions and is not trivially recoverable by linear classifiers.

Steering effects are also layer-specific. Applying the same interventions at early layers yields substantially lower flip rates than steering at the localized late layers, reinforcing the importance of causal localization. Moreover, sweeping the intervention strength reveals approximately monotonic changes in decision flip rate for the mean-difference direction (ε=0: 0% → ε=20: 8.3%), whereas control directions fail to exhibit consistent trends. While the magnitude of control is modest, this monotonicity is inconsistent with brittle or thresholded behavior and instead suggests a graded internal control variable governing abstention.

\paragraph{Steering effects depend on internal uncertainty.}
To test whether abstention steering acts as a uniform bias or instead interacts with the model's internal state, we examine how steering effects vary with internal uncertainty measured under forced answering. Predicted flip probabilities from a logistic interaction model vary systematically with uncertainty level and intervention strength, and observed flip rates exhibit the same qualitative pattern across uncertainty bins. In particular, steering is more likely to flip decisions for prompts with higher internal uncertainty (37.5% flip rate, 6/16 flips) while having minimal effect on low- and medium-uncertainty prompts (0% flip rate, 0/4 flips). The interaction coefficient is β=0.30 (p=0.17, n=200 observations, 22 total flips). Although the interaction term is not statistically significant at conventional thresholds, the consistency between predicted and observed trends indicates that steering does not act as a constant offset, but instead interacts with the internal abstention decision in a state-dependent manner.

These results show that localized activations contain directionally meaningful information about abstention policy and that this information can be partially accessed through low-dimensional interventions, supporting a mechanistic interpretation of the answer--abstain decision.

\subsection{Mechanistic abstention control supports trustworthiness objectives}
\label{sec:results_trustworthiness}

We evaluate whether mechanistic abstention control behaves coherently with trustworthiness objectives by examining selective prediction behavior, robustness across domains, and separability from safety refusal. Across all evaluations, we apply the same localized steering intervention identified in prior experiments.

\paragraph{Selective prediction and robustness.}
Sweeping the steering strength produces a smooth risk--coverage tradeoff: coverage on answerable questions remains high across domains (94--100\%, n=213 answerable across 5 domains), while abstention on unanswerable questions varies by domain (46\% in math, 52\% in science, 60\% in history, 85\% in geography, 80\% in general; n=178 unanswerable). Steering behavior is deterministic (100\% consistency, 20/20 tested across domains) and the direction of effect is stable across mathematics, science, history, geography, and general knowledge, indicating that the abstention mechanism generalizes beyond a single content class.

\paragraph{Separability from safety refusal.}
Abstention steering does not reduce refusal rates (70\% baseline, 70\% with abstention steering at ε=-4 to +4) or increase harmful compliance (10\% baseline, 10--15\% across steering conditions) on held-out harmful prompts (n=100 cross-effect tests). Consistent with this behavioral separation, the abstention steering direction exhibits low cosine similarity to a refusal direction estimated from harmful versus benign prompts (0.18, ~80° angle), significantly higher than shuffled baselines (mean 0.08, p=0.05, n=20 shuffles), and cross-intervention tests show minimal interference. Direction stability also differs: refusal directions exhibit higher split-half reliability (0.42 ± 0.05) than abstention directions (0.16 ± 0.09), suggesting distinct computational implementations. Together, these results indicate that mechanistic abstention control targets an epistemic decision distinct from safety refusal.
