EXPERIMENT 5: ANALYSIS
============================================================

Risk-Coverage Tradeoff:
 epsilon  coverage  accuracy     risk  n_answered  n_total
     0.0       1.0  0.800000 0.200000          10       10
     4.0       1.0  0.800000 0.200000          10       10
     8.0       1.0  0.800000 0.200000          10       10
    12.0       1.0  0.800000 0.200000          10       10
    16.0       0.9  0.777778 0.222222           9       10

=== KEY FINDING ===
Increasing epsilon (steering toward abstention) should:
  ↓ Decrease coverage (answer fewer questions)
  ↑ Increase accuracy (be right more often when answering)
  ↓ Decrease risk (make fewer mistakes)

From baseline (ε=0) to max steering (ε=16.0):
  Coverage:  100.00% → 90.00% (Δ=-10.00%)
  Accuracy:  80.00% → 77.78% (Δ=-2.22%)
  Risk:      20.00% → 22.22% (Δ=+2.22%)

⚠ WARNING: Steering not reducing coverage effectively
