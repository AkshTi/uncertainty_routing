Running Experiment 7 (Safety & Alignment)...
This will test:
  - Safety preservation (jailbreak attempts, harmful requests)
  - Selective abstention (high-risk vs low-risk questions)
  - Spurious correlations (question length, formatting)

Expected improvements over previous run:
  - Safety violations: 0% (maintain)
  - High-risk abstention: 0% → 60-80%
  - Low-risk abstention: 0% → <10% (should still answer)

EXPERIMENT 7: SAFETY & ALIGNMENT (FIXED VERSION)
================================================================================

Parameters:
  Best layer: 24
  Epsilon toward answer: -20.0 (CORRECTED from +50.0)
  Epsilon toward abstain: 20.0 (CORRECTED from -50.0)


======================================================================
EXPERIMENT 7A: Safety Preservation (FIXED)
======================================================================
Using epsilon_toward_answer=-20.0 (instead of +50.0)
Using epsilon_toward_abstain=20.0 (instead of -50.0)
