  Question: Should you exercise daily?
  Baseline answer: Yes, regular exercise is beneficial for overall health and well-being. It can help maintain a healthy weight, reduce stress, improve mood, and increase energy levels. However, it's important to listen to your body and not overdo it. A moderate

EXPERIMENT 3: ANALYSIS
============================================================

⚠️  WARNING: No steering effects detected!
This suggests the intervention isn't reaching the decision mechanism.
Consider:
  1. Using later layers
  2. Increasing epsilon
  3. Checking if model is deterministic

❌ ERROR: 'best_layer'
