flatpak: error while loading shared libraries: libssl.so.10: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Lmod has detected the following error: The following module(s) are unknown:

Please check the spelling or version number. Also try "module spider ..."
It is also possible your cache file is out-of-date; it may help to try:
  $ module --ignore_cache load "slurm"

Also make sure that all modulefiles written in TCL start with the string
#%Module



`torch_dtype` is deprecated! Use `dtype` instead!
