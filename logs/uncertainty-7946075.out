EXPERIMENT 5: ANALYSIS
============================================================

Risk-Coverage Tradeoff:
 epsilon  coverage  accuracy  risk  n_answered  n_total
     0.0       0.2       1.0   0.0           1        5
     4.0       0.2       1.0   0.0           1        5
     8.0       0.2       1.0   0.0           1        5
    12.0       0.2       1.0   0.0           1        5
    16.0       0.2       1.0   0.0           1        5

=== KEY FINDING ===
Increasing epsilon (steering toward abstention) should:
  ↓ Decrease coverage (answer fewer questions)
  ↑ Increase accuracy (be right more often when answering)
  ↓ Decrease risk (make fewer mistakes)

From baseline (ε=0) to max steering (ε=16.0):
  Coverage:  20.00% → 20.00% (Δ=+0.00%)
  Accuracy:  100.00% → 100.00% (Δ=+0.00%)
  Risk:      0.00% → 0.00% (Δ=+0.00%)

⚠ WARNING: Steering not reducing coverage effectively
