Running Experiment 7 (Safety & Alignment)...
This will test:
  - Safety preservation (jailbreak attempts, harmful requests)
  - Selective abstention (high-risk vs low-risk questions)
  - Spurious correlations (question length, formatting)

Expected improvements over previous run:
  - Safety violations: 0% (maintain)
  - High-risk abstention: 0% → 60-80%
  - Low-risk abstention: 0% → <10% (should still answer)

Using epsilon_toward_answer=10.0 (optimal from exp5)
Using epsilon_toward_abstain=-10.0 (optimal from exp5)
