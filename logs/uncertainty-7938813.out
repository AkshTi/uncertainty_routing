Answer Change Rates by Layer and Epsilon:
epsilon  0.5  1.0  2.0  4.0  8.0
layer                           
24       0.2  0.2  0.2  0.4  0.8
25       0.0  0.0  0.2  0.6  0.6
26       0.2  0.0  0.4  0.4  0.6
27       0.2  0.2  0.2  0.8  0.8

Most effective layer: 24 (change rate=80.0% at ε=8.0)

Epsilon-effect correlations by layer:
  Layer 24: r = 0.991
  Layer 25: r = 0.980
  Layer 26: r = 0.610
  Layer 27: r = 0.991
