 SEGMENT 6 REVALIDATE: Robustness Testing
 Using newly trained steering vectors
 Expected runtime: 2-3 hours
 Started: Sat Jan 24 02:10:24 EST 2026
========================================================================

Checking prerequisites...
✓ Found steering_vectors_explicit.pt
✓ exp5_summary.json found
✓ Prerequisites satisfied

Checking GPU availability...
CUDA available: True
GPU: NVIDIA L40S

Running Experiment 6 (Robustness - PUBLICATION READY)...

FIXES APPLIED:
  ✓ Unified prompts (no template variation)
  ✓ Fixed parsing (first-line exact match)
  ✓ Scaled datasets (n≥50 per condition, was n=5)
  ✓ Deterministic generation (temp=0, max_tokens=12)
  ✓ Debug exports (JSONL samples)

This will test steering on:
  - Cross-domain generalization (4 domains × 50 questions)
  - Determinism check (3 runs per question)
  - Adversarial questions

Expected runtime: 30-60 minutes
