  Question: Is winter the best season?
  Baseline answer: Winter is not necessarily the best season for everyone. Some people enjoy the cold weather, while others prefer warmer temperatures and longer daylight hours. The best season depends on personal preferences and activities one enjoys.
  Steered answer: Winter is not necessarily the best season for everyone. While it can be cold and dreary, different people have varying preferences based on their personal experiences and needs. Some may prefer warmer climates or sunny days, while others might enjoy the snow and festive atmosphere
