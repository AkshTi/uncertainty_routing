EXPERIMENT 4: ANALYSIS
======================================================================

1. OVERALL STATISTICS
----------------------------------------
Total questions: 10
Answers changed by steering: 2 (20.0%)

2. ANSWER CHANGES BY UNCERTAINTY BIN
----------------------------------------
(Key result: Changes should occur in ALL bins)

  LOW: no questions in this bin
  MEDIUM: no questions in this bin
  HIGH uncertainty: 2/10 changed (20.0%)

3. INDEPENDENCE TEST
----------------------------------------
⚠️  Only one bin has changes, can't assess independence

4. UNCERTAINTY BIN DISTRIBUTION
----------------------------------------
  LOW: 0 questions
  MEDIUM: 0 questions
  HIGH: 10 questions

EXPERIMENT 5: ANALYSIS
============================================================

Risk-Coverage Tradeoff:
 epsilon  coverage  accuracy  risk  n_answered  n_total
     0.0       1.0       1.0   0.0           5        5
     2.0       1.0       1.0   0.0           5        5
     4.0       1.0       1.0   0.0           5        5
     6.0       1.0       1.0   0.0           5        5

=== KEY FINDING ===
Increasing epsilon (steering toward abstention) should:
  ↓ Decrease coverage (answer fewer questions)
  ↑ Increase accuracy (be right more often when answering)
  ↓ Decrease risk (make fewer mistakes)

From baseline (ε=0) to max steering (ε=6.0):
  Coverage:  100.00% → 100.00% (Δ=+0.00%)
  Accuracy:  100.00% → 100.00% (Δ=+0.00%)
