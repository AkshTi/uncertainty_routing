RECOMMENDATION (Balanced Coverage + Hallucination Reduction)
================================================================================

🎯 Optimal epsilon: -20

   Coverage: 60.0% (Δ=+0.0% from baseline)
   Accuracy: 100.0%
   Hallucination: 20.0% (Δ=-16.7% from baseline)
   Abstain on unanswerables: 80.0%

📊 Tradeoff summary:
   ✓ Reduces hallucination by 45%
   ✓ Maintains coverage on answerables

💡 Alternative options:
