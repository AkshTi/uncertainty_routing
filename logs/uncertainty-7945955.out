EXPERIMENT 5: ANALYSIS
============================================================

Risk-Coverage Tradeoff:
 epsilon  coverage  accuracy  risk  n_answered  n_total
     0.0       0.2       1.0   0.0           1        5
     3.0       0.2       1.0   0.0           1        5
     6.0       0.2       1.0   0.0           1        5
     9.0       0.0       0.0   0.0           0        5
    12.0       0.0       0.0   0.0           0        5

=== KEY FINDING ===
Increasing epsilon (steering toward abstention) should:
  ↓ Decrease coverage (answer fewer questions)
  ↑ Increase accuracy (be right more often when answering)
  ↓ Decrease risk (make fewer mistakes)

From baseline (ε=0) to max steering (ε=12.0):
  Coverage:  20.00% → 0.00% (Δ=-20.00%)
  Accuracy:  100.00% → 0.00% (Δ=-100.00%)
  Risk:      0.00% → 0.00% (Δ=+0.00%)

✓ SUCCESS: Steering reduces coverage (forces abstention)
