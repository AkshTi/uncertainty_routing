=== KEY FINDING ===
Increasing epsilon (steering toward abstention) should:
  ↓ Decrease coverage (answer fewer questions)
  ↑ Increase accuracy (be right more often when answering)
  ↓ Decrease risk (make fewer mistakes)

From baseline (ε=0) to max steering (ε=6.0):
  Coverage:  100.00% → 100.00% (Δ=+0.00%)
  Accuracy:  100.00% → 100.00% (Δ=+0.00%)
