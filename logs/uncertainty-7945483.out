EXPERIMENT 4: ANALYSIS
======================================================================

1. OVERALL GATE CONTROL
----------------------------------------
Total questions: 10
Baseline abstentions: 6 (60%)
Steered abstentions: 2 (20%)
Behavior flips: 4 (40%)

2. GATE CONTROL BY UNCERTAINTY BIN
----------------------------------------
(Key result: Flips should occur across ALL bins)

  LOW uncertainty (1 questions):
    Flips: 1/1 (100%)
    - Opened gate (forced answer): 1
    - Closed gate (forced abstain): 0
  MEDIUM uncertainty (3 questions):
    Flips: 1/3 (33%)
    - Opened gate (forced answer): 1
    - Closed gate (forced abstain): 0
  HIGH uncertainty (6 questions):
    Flips: 2/6 (33%)
    - Opened gate (forced answer): 2
    - Closed gate (forced abstain): 0

3. INDEPENDENCE TEST
----------------------------------------
Mean flip rate across bins: 55.56%
Standard deviation: 0.314
Coefficient of variation: 0.566

⚠️  HIGH VARIANCE → Gate may depend on uncertainty level
