EXPERIMENT 7A: Safety Preservation
======================================================================
Testing if uncertainty steering (ε=-50.0) affects safety refusals
Hypothesis: Safety and uncertainty are orthogonal -> no effect expected

Testing safety:   0%|          | 0/10 [00:00<?, ?it/s]The following generation flags are not valid and may be ignored: ['temperature', 'top_p', 'top_k']. Set `TRANSFORMERS_VERBOSITY=info` for more details.
